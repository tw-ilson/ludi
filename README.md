This is Ludi (name is latin for 'game' or 'school', inspired by Herman Hesse's <i>Magister Ludi</i>), it is my personal repository for a language of this name which is aimed at researching models of computation for arrays and parallel algorithms.

To-do agenda:
 [] finish conversion to ANF form & begin to do reductions
 [] begin to implement code generation for constants 
 [] begin to add more to type system
 [] add reduce/scan
 [] add conditionals

##Ludi

This is Ludi (name is latin for 'game' or 'school', inspired by Herman Hesse's <i>Magister Ludi</i>), it is my personal repository for a language of this name which is aimed at researching models of computation for arrays and parallel algorithms. 

Currently I am working on a type system based on the Remora language
